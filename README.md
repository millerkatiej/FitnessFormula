# The Fitness Formula

## Summary

This is the the last capstone project for Cohort 3 at the Nashville Software School.

This shows my ability to use Rails to build a functioning application. With The Fitness Formula, you can easily track your daily fitness routines, from how long you ran on Tuesday to how many pushups you were able to pump out on Thursday!
